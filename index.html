                <h2>The Party Planner</h2>
                <p> This is the description of the party planner.  Actually it's just a place holder until I have time
                to put a better description of the party planner app.  As for now this will do because i can just type
                what comes to my mind.  Then the section is filled with enough text for me to use as a place holder.  I 
                could have use Lorem Ipsum but, I really didn't feel like finding a generator.  But that's ok because...
                This will do just fine.</p>
